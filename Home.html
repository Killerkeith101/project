           The TV show Game of Thrones is adapted from the book series called “A Song of Ice and Fire” by George RR. Martin. It isn't completed yet but so far he's released five books in the past 25 years starting with “A Game of Thrones” in 1996 “A Clash of Kings” two years later “A Storm of swords” another two years later “A Feast for Crows five years later and “A Dance with Dragons” six years after that in 2011 right after Game of Thrones first aired. George RR. Martin work on the show and everything that comes with it including the books has slowed down his progress on the upcoming book “The Winds of Winter” the last book in the song of ice and fire series planned called “A Dream of Spring” but who knows if two more novels are enough to wrap up the story.
           In addition there are three prequel novellas currently available, with several more being planned, and a series of novella-length excerpts from the main Ice and Fire novels.

        <section class="Home">                                                        
            <p>
          Did you know the series was to only be a trilogy and it has since turned to 7 large novels with increasingly longer page numbers when outlining the story for his publishers he said the first book would be called “A Game of Thrones” and focus on the House Stark and Lannister conflict the second book was originally going to be “A Dance of Dragons And be about Daenerys invading Westeros with the Dothraki the third book in the trilogy was supposed to be “The Winds of Winter” but focus on the biggest threat the white walkers it seems like he's underestimated his imagination.
